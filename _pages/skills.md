### Reading Comprehension

As a PhD Candidate, one of my most important skills is reading comprehension: the high speed and high accuracy with which I intake information and *analyze* it for patterns, insights, and key takeaways. For a concrete demonstration of my reading comprehension skills, see my book reviews on <a href="https://cimsec.org/by-more-than-providenceby-more-than-providence-grand-strategy-and-american-power-in-the-asia-pacific-since-1783/">By More Than Providence: Grand Strategy and American Power in the Asia Pacific Since 1783</a> and <a href="https://networks.h-net.org/node/28443/reviews/9356837/pollmann-midford-overcoming-isolationism-japan%E2%80%99s-leadership-east">Overcoming Isolationism: Japan's Leadership in East Asian Security Multilateralism</a>.

### Written Communication

As a PhD Candidate, another important skill is written communication: the high speed and high clarity with which I write, *synthesizing* all the information, as well as the patterns, insights, and key takeaways I distilled from my readings and interviews. I have always been a fast reader, but I became a fast - and clear - writer during my junior year abroad at the University of Oxford, where the tutorial system meant we were writing three essays every two weeks. I am also adept at tailoring my writing to different audiences and different formats. Longer form work includes peer-reviewed articles such as  <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10357718.2015.1034088?journalCode=caji20">"Australia's submarine technology cooperation with Japan as burden-sharing with the USA in the Asia-Pacific"</a>, and shorter form work includes pieces I have written for <a href="https://thediplomat.com/authors/mina-pollmann/">The Diplomat</a> and various other outlets. 

### Expert Interviews

Interviewing experts is one of my core skills. I have used expert interviews in various formal roles - including as a columnist for The Diplomat, news producer for a Japanese TV broadcaster, and risk consultant at a risk intelligence startup - as well as for independent research projects. Talking to experts and being able to ask them questions is one of the best ways to *research* a new topic. I focus on trying to ask questions that probe the expert to think of the issue in a new way or uncover an angle that deserves further attention. For some samples of my expert interview skills, see my published interview with <a href="https://cimsec.org/sea-control-130-stephen-biddle-future-warfare-western-pacific/">Stephen Biddle</a> on the future of warfare in the Western Pacific, and a published written piece based on my interview with <a href="https://www.blackpeakgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Blackpeak-RANE-Interview-David-Suzuki-Japan-Rolls-Dice-on-Legalizing-Casinos.pdf">David Suzuki</a> on the risks of casino legalization in Japan. I also relied heavily on interviews when writing this article for The Diplomat on the <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2015/10/the-truth-about-japans-defense-exports/">lifting of Japan's arms embargo</a> and this article on the <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2015/12/japans-controversial-state-secrets-law-one-year-later/">one-year anniversary of Japan's new state secrets law</a>.
