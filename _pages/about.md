*PNW spirit, DC vibes, Global citizen*

I am originally from Washington state, and went to Georgetown University for my BS in Foreign Service. I worked for the DC bureau of a Japanese TV broadcaster and a DC-based risk intelligence startup before pursuing my PhD in Political Science at MIT. During my PhD, I was funded by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. I have lived abroad in Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. My time in Tokyo included a Visiting Research Fellowship with the University of Tokyo, Institute of Social Science, and my time in the UK was for studying abroad at University of Oxford, Mansfield College. I have native-level fluency in English and Japanese.
