*PNW spirit, DC vibes, Global citizen*

I am originally from Washington state, and went to Georgetown University for my undergraduate degree. I worked for the DC bureau of a Japanese TV broadcaster and a DC-based risk intelligence startup before beginning my PhD program at MIT. 
I have lived abroad in Japan (for family reasons, independent research, and as a Visiting Research Fellow at the University of Tokyo), Germany (for family reasons), and the United Kingdom (studying abroad at Mansfield College, University of Oxford). I have native-level fluency in English and Japanese. 


I am looking forward to being a Geopolitical Intern with <a href="https://inthewhitespace.com/">Whitespace</a> in summer 2022, and an International Security Program Predoctoral Fellow at Harvard <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/program/international-security">Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs</a> in the 2022-23 academic year.
