*PNW spirit, DC vibes, Global citizen*

I am originally from Washington state, and went to Georgetown University for my undergraduate degree. I worked for the DC bureau of a Japanese TV broadcaster and a DC-based risk intelligence startup before beginning my PhD program at MIT. 
I have lived abroad in Japan (for family reasons, independent research, and Visiting Research Fellow at the University of Tokyo), Germany (for family reasons), and the United Kingdom (studying abroad at Mansfield College, University of Oxford).
