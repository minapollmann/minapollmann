*PNW spirit, DC vibes, Cambridge livin'*

I am originally from Washington state, and did my undergraduate degree at Georgetown University. I worked for the DC bureau of a Japanese TV broadcaster and a DC-based risk intelligence startup. I am currently doing my PhD at MIT. I have lived abroad in Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom.
