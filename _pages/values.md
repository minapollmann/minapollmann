### Relevant

I care about the real world and want to do work that is relevant to the real world. I was passionate about writing for <a href="https://thediplomat.com/authors/mina-pollmann/">The Diplomat</a> because I was helping readers understand world events in real time. 

### Original

I am inspired when I am doing original work. Being original requires both creativity to come up with new ideas, and the courage to stick by them. I am currently working on developing probabilistic counterfactual analysis as a method for historical research (working paper coming soon). This is, as far as I know, the most innovative methodological breakthrough in counterfactual analysis for studying political and diplomatic history since Frank Harvey developed comparative counterfactual analysis in 2012. Being original also means participating in the global discourse as someone willing to point out contradictions or difficult trade-offs, and someone at the cutting-edge of future challenges and opportunities. It was in this spirit that I wrote this article for The Tokyo Review on the <a href="https://www.tokyoreview.net/2019/06/us-japan-embrace-unequal-alliance/">need to recalibrate US and Japanese expectations for the alliance to be more realistic</a> and this article on the <a href="https://www.tokyoreview.net/2021/02/japan-can-remain-an-important-u-s-ally-despite-demographic-challenges/">impact of Japan's aging on the functioning of the US-Japan alliance</a>.
