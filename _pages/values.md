### Relevant

I care about the real world and want to do work that is relevant to the real world. I was passionate about writing for <a href="https://thediplomat.com/authors/mina-pollmann/">The Diplomat</a> because I was helping readers understand world events in real time. 

### Original

I am inspired when I am doing original work. Being original requires both creativity to come up with new ideas, and the courage to stick by them. I am currently working on developing probabilistic counterfactual analysis as a method for historical research (working paper coming soon). This is (as far as I know) the most innovative methodological breakthrough in counterfactual analysis for studying political and diplomatic history since Frank Harvey developed comparative counterfactual analysis in 2012.
