### Sustainability

This is my newest field of interest. I am actively trying to learn more about sustainability in general, and specifically about the intersection of sustainability and the US military, sustainability and the defense industry, sustainability and international diplomacy, and sustainability in the Asia-Pacific. 

### International Security

I have been pursuing my interest in international security since Georgetown, and deepened my commitment to this area of study by choosing to do my PhD at MIT, which is renown for its Security Studies Program. 

### Japanese Politics

I have also been pursuing my interest in Japanese politics since Georgetown, and my dissertation focuses on Japan's diplomatic history.
