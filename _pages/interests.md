### Sustainability

This is my newest field of interest. I am actively trying to learn more about sustainability in general, and specifically about the intersection of sustainability and the US defense industry, international diplomacy, and the Asia-Pacific. 

### International Security

I have been pursuing my interest in international security since Georgetown, and deepened my commitment to this area of study by choosing to do my PhD at MIT, which is renown for its Security Studies Program. Theoretically, my dissertation observes patterns in the role of agency in alliance formation, and draws out implications from this synthesis for contemporary international politics. 

### Japanese Politics

I have also been pursuing my interest in Japanese politics since Georgetown. I have been invited to participate in academic and Track 1.5 conferences in Tokyo and the United States and conducted multiple research trips to Tokyo - both before and during my PhD program. Substantively, my dissertation focuses on Japan's diplomatic history and analyses all fourteen great power alliances that were seriously considered by Japanese leaders.
