### International Security

I have pursued my interest in international security since my undergraduate days at Georgetown University, and deepened my commitment to this area of study by pursuing my PhD at MIT, which is renown for its <a href="https://ssp.mit.edu/">Security Studies Program</a>. Theoretically, my dissertation observes patterns in the role of agency in alliance formation, and draws out implications from this synthesis for contemporary international politics. I have written on international security issues for <a href="https://thediplomat.com/authors/mina-pollmann/">*The Diplomat*</a> and various other outlets including <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/feature/russia-vs-japan-asias-forgotten-island-fight-15942">The National Interest</a> and <a href="https://www.eastwestcenter.org/publications/opening-australias-black-box-the-domestic-debate-over-submarine-production">Asia-Pacific Bulletin</a>.

### Japanese Politics

I have also pursued my interest in Japanese politics since my time at Georgetown and am continuing to do so at MIT. I have been invited to participate in academic and Track 1.5 conferences in Tokyo and the United States and conducted multiple research trips to Tokyo - both before and during my PhD program. Empirically, my dissertation focuses on Japan's diplomatic history and analyzes all fourteen great power alliances that were seriously considered by Japanese leaders. I have also written on Japanese politics for <a href="https://thediplomat.com/authors/mina-pollmann/">*The Diplomat*</a> and various other outlets including <a href="https://www.tokyoreview.net/author/minapollmann/">The Tokyo Review</a> and <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/resolved-japan-has-not-done-enough-bolster-immigration">Debating Japan (CSIS)</a>.
