### International Security & US Foreign Policy

I have pursued my interest in international security and US foreign policy since my undergraduate days at Georgetown University, and deepened my commitment to this area of study by pursuing my PhD at MIT, which is renown for its <a href="https://ssp.mit.edu/">Security Studies Program</a>. Theoretically, my dissertation develops a seven-part typology of realist anti-alliance concerns and examines which factors facilitate alliance formation by comparing cases of successful and *failed* alliance formation. This focus on failed alliance negotiations is novel, and the conclusions underscore the importance of domestic politics as an explanation for alliance formation success or failure. I have written on international security issues and US foreign policy for <a href="https://thediplomat.com/authors/mina-pollmann/">*The Diplomat*</a> and various other outlets including <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/feature/russia-vs-japan-asias-forgotten-island-fight-15942">The National Interest</a> and <a href="https://www.eastwestcenter.org/publications/opening-australias-black-box-the-domestic-debate-over-submarine-production">Asia-Pacific Bulletin</a>.

### Japanese Politics

I have also pursued my interest in Japanese politics since my time at Georgetown and continued to do so at MIT. I have been invited to participate in academic and Track 1.5 conferences in Tokyo and the Washington, DC and conducted multiple research trips to Tokyo. Empirically, my dissertation focuses on Japan's diplomatic history and analyzes *the universe* of alliance negotiations Japan pursued both successfully and unsuccessfully. I have also written on Japanese politics for <a href="https://thediplomat.com/authors/mina-pollmann/">*The Diplomat*</a> and various other outlets including <a href="https://www.tokyoreview.net/author/minapollmann/">The Tokyo Review</a> and <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/resolved-japan-has-not-done-enough-bolster-immigration">Debating Japan (CSIS)</a>.
