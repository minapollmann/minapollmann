Fifth year PhD Candidate in Political Science at MIT 

<br>

Researching the role of leaders' agency in Japan's alliances

<br>
<br>

I want to bring my reading comprehension, written communication, and expert interview skills to a role 
<br>
where I can do work that reflects my values of relevance, originality, and essentialism
<br>
Sustainability is my new interest, and international security and Japanese politics are my traditional interests, but I am open to exploring any new opportunities
<br>
in the private sector; federal, state, and local governments; and international organizations

<br> 
<br> 

Looking forward to being a Geopolitical Intern with <a href="https://inthewhitespace.com/">Whitespace</a> in summer 2022, and 

<br>

an International Security Program Predoctoral Fellow at Harvard <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/program/international-security">Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs</a>

<br>

in the 2022-23 academic year
