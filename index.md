Fifth year PhD Candidate in Political Science at MIT 

<br>

Researching the role of leaders' agency in Japan's alliances

<br>
<br>

I want to bring my research & analysis, synthesis & communication, and expert interview <a href="https://www.minapollmann.com/skills/">skills</a>  
<br>
to a role where I can do work that reflects my <a href="https://www.minapollmann.com/values/">values</a> of relevance & impact, originality, and essentialism

<br>
<br>

Sustainability, international security, and Japanese politics are my current main <a href="https://www.minapollmann.com/interests/">interests</a>, 
<br>
but I am open to exploring any new opportunities
<br>
in the private sector, federal, state, and local governments, and international organizations
