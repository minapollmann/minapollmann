Fifth year PhD Candidate in Political Science at MIT 

<br>

Researching the role of leaders' agency in Japan's alliances

<br>
<br>

I want to bring my reading comprehension, written communication, and expert interview <i>skills</i>  
<br>
to a role where I can do work that reflects my <i>values</i> of relevance, originality, and essentialism

<br>
<br>

Sustainability, international security, and Japanese politics are my current main <i>interests</i>, 
<br>
but I am open to exploring any new opportunities
<br>
in the private sector, federal, state, and local governments, and international organizations
